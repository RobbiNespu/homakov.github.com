Take any tweet id (.../username/status/<b>482142996411207680</b>) <input id="tweet" value="482142996411207680"> 
<input type=submit value="Did I retweet it?" onclick=run('retweet')>
<input type=submit value="Did I favorite it?" onclick=run('favorite')>
<br>
Is it useful to detect current user? Yes, when we have a small group of people having favorites/retweets in common (we need to analyze their entire timeline to get better results). <br>We start with the most popular tweets (world cup, oscar, jokes, etc), if any of them worked now current user is in the target group of people who retweeted/favorited the tweet we checked. Next we keep showing the user tweets that can distinguish him from others. Maths.

<script>
function run(type){

  id = document.getElementById('tweet').value
  var x=window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/'+type+'?tweet_id='+id); 
  setTimeout(function(){
    try{
      href = x.location.href
      alert('Yes')
    }catch(e){
      x.close()
      alert('No')
    }
  }, 6000) //depends on your internet connection
}
